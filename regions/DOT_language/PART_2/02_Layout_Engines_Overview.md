Graphviz is not a single layout algorithm but a suite of tools, each providing different layout engines. The choice of engine dramatically affects the final appearance of the graph. Users select an engine based on the type of graph structure and the desired visual emphasis.

The engine is typically chosen by the command used (e.g., `dot`, `neato`) or sometimes via a `-Kengine` flag.

mindmap
  root((Graphviz Layout Engines))
    dot
      ::icon(fa fa-sitemap)
      Default for hierarchical or layered drawings of directed graphs.
      Excellent for DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs), flowcharts, hierarchies (org charts, call graphs).
      Arranges nodes in ranks/levels.
      Minimizes edge crossings and tries to point edges in the main flow direction (e.g., top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
      Attributes: `rankdir`, `ranksep`, `nodesep`.
    neato
      ::icon(fa fa-project-diagram)
      "Network Embellisher, After Tom Sawyer's Outhouse"
      Uses "spring model" or "energy minimization" algorithms (e.g., Kamada-Kawai).
      Treats edges as springs and nodes as repelling objects. Finds a layout with minimal energy.
      Good for undirected graphs where structure is more important than flow.
      Suitable for visualizing networks, social graphs.
      Attributes: `len` (optimal edge length), `epsilon` (convergence threshold).
    fdp
      ::icon(fa fa-share-alt-square)
      Force-Directed Placement. Similar to `neato` but uses a different force-directed algorithm (Fruchterman-Reingold).
      Also good for large undirected graphs.
      May handle larger graphs better than `neato` in some cases.
    twopi
      ::icon(fa fa-bullseye)
      Radial layouts. Places nodes in concentric circles around a central root.
      Root node is chosen (or can be specified with `root` attribute).
      Good for showing distance from a central item.
    circo
      ::icon(fa fa-circle-notch)
      Circular layouts. Identifies biconnected components (maximal subgraphs where removal of any single vertex leaves it connected) and circular structures.
      Arranges nodes in circles or ellipses.
      Suitable for certain network topologies, like ring networks.
    sfdp
      ::icon(fa fa-cubes)
      Scalable Force-Directed Placement. A multiscale version of `fdp` for laying out very large graphs.
    patchwork
      ::icon(fa fa-th-large)
      Draws the graph as a squarified treemap. The graph must be a tree. Node sizes correspond to `area` attribute.
    osage
      ::icon(fa fa-object-group)
      Draws graph using a "cluster" layout algorithm.

## Choosing an Engine

*   **Hierarchies, Flowcharts, DAGs:** `dot` is almost always the best choice.
*   **Undirected Networks, Connectivity:** `neato` or `fdp` are good starting points. `sfdp` for very large graphs.
*   **Hub-and-Spoke, Center-Focused:** `twopi` can be effective.
*   **Ring or Cyclic Structures:** `circo` might produce interesting layouts.

**Example Command-Line Usage:**

*   `dot -Tpng input.dot -o output.png` (Uses `dot` engine)
*   `neato -Tpng input.dot -o output.png` (Uses `neato` engine)
*   `fdp -Tsvg input.dot -o output.svg` (Uses `fdp` engine)
*   `graphviz -Ktwopi -Tpdf input.dot -o output.pdf` (Generic `graphviz` command explicitly choosing `twopi` engine)

The DOT language itself primarily describes the graph's logical structure and attributes. The chosen layout engine then interprets this description to produce the geometric layout. While most DOT files are written with the `dot` engine's hierarchical layout in mind (e.g., using `rankdir`), the same DOT file can often be processed by other engines to yield different visual perspectives. Experimenting with different engines can sometimes reveal insights about the graph's structure that one engine alone might not highlight as effectively.
